  abstract = {It is very common to find meta-analyses in which some of the
  studies compare 2 groups on continuous dependent variables and others compare
  groups on dichotomized variables. Integrating all of them in a meta-analysis
  requires an effect-size index in the same metric that can be applied to both
  types of outcomes. In this article, the performance in terms of bias and
  sampling variance of 7 different effect-size indices for estimating the
  population standardized mean difference from a 2 x 2 table is examined by
  Monte Carlo simulation, assuming normal and nonnormal distributions. The
  results show good performance for 2 indices, one based on the probit
  transformation and the other based on the logistic distribution.},
